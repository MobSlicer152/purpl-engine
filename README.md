# purpl-engine
This is my third attempt at making a game engine. Having learned from those attempts, I think this one will be good. My goal is to at some point have the facilities necessary to create a game. The engine will be written in C, because C is for superior beings.

## Libraries I plan on using
These are some really awesome libraries that have served me well in my past attempts:
- [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) is a great math library for doing linear algebra in C (good for graphics in particular)
- [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) is an amazing OpenGL loader
- [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) is good for parsing JSON
- [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) is a collection of wonderful open source libraries contained in single header files
